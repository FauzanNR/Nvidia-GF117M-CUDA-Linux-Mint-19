# Nvidia-GF117M-CUDA-Linux-Mint-19
This is the resume from what I've done and what I've got when trying to install CUDA on my Linux Mint 19.3, perhaps it will help you in order to install CUDA technology

I have the old device that uses GF117M(F for fermi) which is the 2nd generation support with CUDA. check this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA :D

# Requirement 

check on the link below to make sure your device is compatible with CUDA but don't follow the instruction at all :D maybe it will break your device
